# Simple-Lighting-Controller
Smart Lighting Controller with Machine Learning, loT, and API integration

Concept:

This project is an energy saving lighting controller designed to optimize energy consumption using machine learning, loT hardware, and API-driven automation. The system dynamically adjusts lighting based on ambient conditions, user preferences, and real time energy efficiency metrics. By integrating an loT enabled microcontroller (Raspberry Pi 4 model B) with a responsive API and trained ML model. Users can interact with the system through an API or an optional user-friendly web interface. 



To develop this system, project is divided into structured phases:

1. loT hardware setup

Configure a microcontroller with an ambient light sensor and an LED or smart bulb to establish basic light control

2. API Development

Implement REST API using Flask or FastAPI to manage lighting states and brightness levels

3. Machine Learning Integration

Train and deploy a ML model and predict optimal lighting settings based on environmental inputs

4. System Integration

Connect the loT hardware to the backend API, allowing real-time sensor data to inform intelligent lighting adjustments

5. Frontend Development (Optional)

Create a web or mobile application to enable user interaction with the system
